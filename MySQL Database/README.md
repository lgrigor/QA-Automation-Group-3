The goal is to practice working with databases, tables.

1. Connect to the MySQL host
     host = "##.##.#.###",
     user = "guest",
     passwd = "iM9]M)bS-G"

2. Create a database with your name "Firstname_Lastname"

3. Create table (choose correct table name, column names and datatypes according to data)

4. Insert the bottom lines at once
('Airi Sato', 'Accountant', 'Tokyo', 33, '2008/11/28'),
("Angelica Ramos", "Chief Executive Officer (CEO)", "London", 47, "2009/10/09"),
("Ashton Cox", "Junior Technical Writer", "San Francisco", 66, "2009/01/12"),
("Bradley Greer", "Software Engineer", "London", 41, "2012/10/13"),
("Brenden Wagner", "Software Engineer", "San Francisco", 28, "2011/06/07")

5. Delete the lines that contain the word "software engineer".

6. Print lines where the month of the date (5-th column) is 10
